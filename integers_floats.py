#! Integers and Floats - Working with Numeric Data

# Numbers in python are generally working with integers and floats
# Int: whole number
# Float: decimal

# Python has a built-in function called type, where we can see the datatype of an object

num = 3
num2 = 3.14

print(type(num))
print(type(num2))

#? Arithmetic Operators:

# Division /

print(3/2)

# Floor Division //

print(3//2)

# Modulu (remainders)

print(3%2)

# Even or Odd

print(2%2)
print(3%2)
print(4%2)
print(5%2)

# Incrementing variables

num = 1
num = num + 1

#aka

num = 1
num += 1

# Round
# Round our values to the nearest integer value

print(round(3.75))

# Round to certain digit

print(round(3.75, 1))
